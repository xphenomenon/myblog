Actually I would like to write this blog about programming, and something else.

So how could I do this? The very point of this is to do more practice on This one.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. So go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

I believe you'll find it very interesting. OK let's try it out.

{{ site.name }}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
